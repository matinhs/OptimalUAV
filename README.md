# Minimum-Input Optimal Control of a Quadrotor in Wind Using Lie Group Variational Integrator and CasADi

This project implements **minimum-input optimal control** of a quadrotor UAV operating in a **wind field** using **Lie group variational integrators** (discrete mechanics on SE(3)) and the **CasADi** symbolic framework for nonlinear optimization. The goal is to minimize control effort while tracking a desired point in space.
